## Context

<!-- the ecography paper paper should help here -->
rmangal is a R client for MANGAL API. MANGAL is a collection of 172
datasets representing over 1300 published ecological networks.
[](http://www.mangal.io/about/). In 2016, a first paper was published with the
first release of rmangal [@poisot_mangal_2016]. Since then, the API has been
re-written and several ecological networks have been added.

<div class = "col-md-6">

**Reference** -- Informations about the publication (scientific article, book, online website, etc.) containing
the original networks. URLs of data and publication sources are accessible as well as the DOI
which offers the potential to interact with other online tools, such as the CrossRef API.

**Dataset** -- Collection of one or several network(s) attached to a reference.

**Networks**  -- Series of nodes and interactions, along with information on sampling location and
date.

**Nodes** -- Informations on the population, taxa or individu in the network. Each node has an
original name / taxonomy and a homogeneized taxonomy based on the Catalogue of Life taxonomic
backbone. 

**Interactions** -- Informations on the interaction type (e.g mutualism, predation etc.), the
strength, and the direction of the interaction between two nodes.

## How to use rmangal

`rmangal` includes 5 search functions to quickly identify references, datasets
or relevant ecological networks available in the database:

- `search_reference()`: search reference by `doi`;
- `search_datasets()`: search among datasets using a keyword;
- `search_networks()`: search networks based on a keyword or a geographical area;
- `search_interactions()`: list all networks containing a specific interaction type;
- `search_taxa()`: identify nodes based on taxonomic informations;

All these functions return specific objects containing the information needed
to retrieve the set of corresponding ecological networks with
`get_collection()`.

```r
networks <- search_*() %>% get_collection()
```

If there is only one network to be retrieved, `get_collection()` returns a `mgNetwork` object, otherwise it returns a object of class  `mgNetworksCollection` which is a collection (a list) of `mgNetwork` objects.


```r
ref <- get_collection(networks)
```

Below, we illustrate this in more details.


## Search functions

### Find networks by reference (`DOI`)

```{R}
seifert_1979 <- search_reference(doi = "10.2307/1936064")
# Number of networks
nrow(seifert_1979$networks)
```

### List and search in datasets

We can list all datasets containing the word `lagoon` in the dataset description.

```{R}
lagoon <- search_datasets(query = 'lagoon')
```

In absence of keyword, `search_datasets()` will always list all datasets. All `search_*` functions
will have this same default behaviour.

```{R}
all_datasets <- search_datasets()
head(all_datasets)
```

### List and search in networks

We can also search networks by keyword

```{R}
insect_coll <- search_networks(query="insect%") 
head(insect_coll)
```

If we are interested by a specific study area, we can easily filter networks based on their locations. 

```{R}
area <- us_states(state = "california")
in_CA <- search_networks(area)
mapview(in_CA, legend = FALSE)
```

### Search for a specific interaction type

It is also easy to retrieve all interactions by type.

```{R}
# List all interaction type available
avail_type()
comp_interac <- search_interactions(type="competition")
# Number of competition interactions in mangal
nrow(comp_interac)
```

### Search for a specific taxa

We can search for taxa documented by the authors of the publication with `original = TRUE`. 

```{R}
sr_ficus <- search_taxa("Ficus", original = FALSE)
```

Most of the nodes documented by authors will use scientific names. However, some networks track
interaction among individu by pasting the scientific name with unique ID and thus lowering the number
of matches return by `rmangal` for a specific taxa. To avoid this problem, it is possible to instead
query the taxonomy backbone using `original = FALSE`. The taxonomy backbone contains a homogeneized
taxonomy done with taxize [@chamberlain_2019].

This function allows to search a taxa based on EOL, TSN, GBIF, COL IDs. 

```{R}
search_taxa(tsn = 28749)
search_taxa(eol =  583069)
```

## Get networks associated to `search_*`

We can retrieve the ecological networks based on the `search_*`.

```{R}
nets_lagoons <- get_collection(lagoon)
nets_in_CA <- get_collection(in_CA)
nets_competition <- get_collection(comp_interac)
```

Each network within the collection will always have the following structure:

```{R}
nets_lagoons[[1]]
```

## Coerce network to `igraph`

A collection of networks can easily be coerce as an `igraph` object.

```{R}
ig_laggons_coll <- as.igraph(nets_lagoons)
```

## Get BibTeX for the networks collection

We can easily get a BibTeX of all publications involved in the networks collection.

```{R}
get_citation(nets_in_CA)
```
